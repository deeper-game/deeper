# Deeper

Deeper is a work in progress cooperative first person roguelike dungeon crawler game where spells are programs. Each time you start the game, you will be given a set of _intrinsics_, which allow you to compute certain functions using less mana. A spell is a program that solves computational puzzles given to it using intrinsics. The more puzzles the spell program can solve per unit of mana, the more damage it will do. The type of puzzle you choose to solve changes the effects of the spell. Additionally, spells can make decisions based on information about the world, like the armor of the targeted enemy -- but beware, these queries are expensive in terms of mana!

Currently, Deeper is in an extremely primitive state. You can try out the latest build [here](http://deeper.quest).
